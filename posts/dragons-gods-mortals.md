Even the Elves' epic sagas only go back two-thousand years. Before that time there are myths of Dragons who battled the
Deities for control of the world. It is said the Deities walked amongst us, commanding legions of mortals shaped in
their image. Now, victorious they have retired to their realms in the heavens and hells, leaving the material plane to
their mortals.

## The Pantheons and Races
The Deities and races of this world are inextricably linked. To fight against the dragons, the deities took the mortals
of the world and shaped them for war. Each race owes something of their ancestry to this. Those that devote their lives
to a chosen deity manifest this to a much greater extent as the divine power gifted to them leaves its mark.

### Elves
Infused with the magics of the Fey Wild elves are an otherworldly, mystical people. They follow three sibling Deities,
Rillifane Rallathil, They of the Wild, who opened the elves up to the Fey; Corellon Larethain, He of the Sun who taught
the elves Art and Magic that they may be more than beasts; and Sehanine Moonbow, She of the Moon, who taugt the elves of
Song and Saga, that they might keep and spread their knowledge.

### Dwarves
Moradin is said to have forged the dwarves from the very rock of the Spire Mountains. Moradin's child Baern forged them
armour and weapons, and Moradin's child Thodris led them to war, wielding the storms from the highest peaks. Moradin
remebered all their deeds, and watched over them all, in life and in death. They instilled in their creations a great
sense of familiy and community, and the Dwarves have always worked hard together to achieve great things.

### Gnomes
Created from the union of Rillifane Rallathil and Baern, Garl Glittergold is a mischievous melding of Elf and Dwarf. He
created the Gnomes in his image, and both his parents blessed his creations. Some are mischievous forest sprites, whilst
others are innovative tinkerers, but all bring joy to the world and those around them.

### Halflings
Halflings are a people of hearth and home. Yondalla and her partner Randall took it upon themselves to ensure the mortal
armies did not lose hope in the horrors of war. Yondalla teaches the halflings to care for and revel in the life and the
world that the deities and mortals wrested from the dragons. Randall is the patron of guardians and crafters, those who
make sure mortals are prepared for the worst.

### Goblins
Lyzaxa is part of the pantheon responsible for the goblinoid races, along with Hruggek patron of bugbears, and
Maglubiyet patron of hobgoblins. As a pantheon they revere survival above all else, but only Lyzaxa's ideal of survival
through cunning has allowed integration with the other mortal races. Each shaman of Lyzaxa teaches their own
interpretation of their deities teachings, and as many of these work against the Alliance as with it. 

### Humans
Scholars debate if the humans were the original people of this world, or if they too were created by the deities. There
is certainly no pantheon that claims them, but the deities of the other races will happily reward their faith. The
humans are the most widespread and versatile of the races of the world. 

### Dragonborn
These take their name from the suspicion that they are what remains of the armies of the dragons, though whether this is
true is lost in the mists of time. Certainly it is rare that one of them can channel divine magic. Most dragonborn in
the Alliance are travellers; mercenaries, traders, sailors, and explorers. Tribes of nomadic dragonborn wander the
desert to the south, and will trade with the towns on the Alliances southern border. If they have knowledge of what lies
beyond, they have not shared it with the Guilds.

### Other Races
The humans mutability has resulted in a number of half-breeds; half-elves are the most common of these as humans and
elves have a history of shared communities. Whether tieflings are a race shaped by the deities of the Hells, or a
product of mortal relationships with the fiends that inhabit them is not clear. Their hellish appearance leads to
suspicion, but they seem to have the free-will of any other mortal race. 

The warring orc tribes to the far north seem constantly at odds with each other, and the other goblinoid races,
nevermind the other mortals. Created by Gruumsh for the most brutal fights of the dragon war, they now know nothing
else. The fallen city of Valeguard had a small population of exiles, and there are still half-orc refugees living
amongst the towns that cling to the shores of the Dragon's Maw.

There are also merfolk who inhabit the Endless Ocean, and even trade up the Alliance's rivers. They seem uncomfortable
out of water and have not integrated with the Alliance even as much as the Dragonborn have. Of the deities they worship,
Eadro who promotes adapting to the harsh marine environment sees some worship from Alliance sailors.
