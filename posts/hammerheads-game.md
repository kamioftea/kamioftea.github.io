Hammerheads is set in the near future as climate change really starts to bite. You play an agent of the secretive World
Crisis Organisation. The WCO is an elite group recruited from first responders, military, aid workers, and scientists.
Their Hammerhead craft (High-Altitude, Multi-Mission, Emergency Response HEADquarters) allow them to be first on the
scene when disaster strikes. It takes inspiration from Thunderbirds and various disaster movies, and is intended to be
episodic with each session seeing the team tackle a new crisis.

All the rules and background needed to play are free online, as this is the sample setting available on the Cortex
Website.

} %}

Everything will be explained during play anyway, so read as much or as little as you have time for.

<h2>Script Change RPG Toolkit</h2>

Roleplaying should be safe and fun for everyone. We'll be using the Script Change RPG Toolkit to help faciltate this. 

{% renderFile './_includes/cards/bookmark.njk', {
 "url": "https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/",
 "title": "Script Change RPG Toolbox",
 "icon_url": "https://i0.wp.com/briebeau.com/thoughty/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-ThoughtyC_text-1.png?fit=192%2C192&ssl=1",
 "publisher": "Thoughty",
 "image_url": "https://i0.wp.com/briebeau.com/thoughty/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-ThoughtyC_text-1.png?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1",
 "content": "The formatted, printable Script Change file can be downloaded here. Find full page table safety tool references from Tomer Gurantz,​ and index card references here from Tomer as well!​ Script …"
} %}

This adds a bunch of tools for skipping, redoing, changing pace. It can be used if something is making you
uncomfortable, or if you've just made a mistake, or had a better idea. 

We'll open session zero with a discussion to allow players and the game moderator to discuss any topics to avoid or
approach cautiously, and how we want to use the tools. If anyone has something they want to be avoided, but don't feel
comfortable bringing up during a group discussion, feel free to message me privately.

The interrupt tools (pause, rewind, etc.) will be available as emojis in Discord, and should be included in the shared
dice roller too.

<h2>Character Building</h2>

All you need to start with is a rough outline of the character you'd like to play, their name, and preferred pronouns.
e.g.

<ul>
    <li>
        Anna Smith, She/Her - An aid worker who has voluteered for charity work since what was supposed to be a gap year.
    </li>
    <li>
        Uhtred Ran, He/Him - Ex-special forces, who is self reliant to a fault.
    </li>
    <li>
        Chris Tine, They/Them - Physicist with ADHD, worked on the Hammerhead designs.
    </li>
</ul>

You can play a character as similar or different from yourself as you like. If you are portraying someone with different
life experiences to your own, make sure to consider how to do so respectfully.

You will also need a discord account, and a Google account to access the Pathways Map. Please also download a character
sheet.

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cortexrpg.com/cdn/media/compendium/cortex-prime-game-handbook/CortexPrime-CharacterFile-Hammerheads.pdf">Standard</a> - to print and fill in.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cortexrpg.com/cdn/media/compendium/cortex-prime-game-handbook/CortexPrime-CharacterFileFillable-Hammerheads.pdf">Form-fillable</a> - to fill in digitally.
    </li>
</ul>

I'll be expanding on the provided character generation steps using a version of the Pathways. All of the below will be
introduced and explained during the session as well.

<h3>Pathways - Mapping out the setting.</h3>

Beyond the basic premise, very little about the setting is defined. This is intentional. Alongside building characters
we will work together to build a setting around and connected to the characters.

Character generation will proceed through five stages. During each stage you will add new setting elements and/or link
them to your character. Each stage also has a perticular trait or trait set to fill out on your character sheet, which
will be done once everyone, including the Game Moderator, has had their chance to add to the map for that stage. 

The map will be built on google slides to enable us all to edit it at once. There are four types of elements that can be
added to the map.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 8rem;">
                <img src="https://static.goblinoid.co.uk/jeff-horton.uk/4133b303-d0d1-494e-b23f-f6d59c0688e5.png" alt="Rectangle (PC): Anna Smith" />
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>
                <strong>Rectangles: Player Characters</strong>: The protagonists and focus of the the game and setting. The map starts with the players distributed around the edges.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <img src="https://static.goblinoid.co.uk/jeff-horton.uk/c558e39d-154d-4c4b-a6a0-e04b80393986.png" alt="Oval (GMC): Herbert West" />
            </th>
            <td>
                <strong>Ovals: Game Moderator Characters</strong>: Other characers that feature in the setting. Will be portrayed by the Game Moderator if they turn up in play. 
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <img src="https://static.goblinoid.co.uk/jeff-horton.uk/54815db1-9af0-4b13-afac-7e01f3e8913d.png" alt="Diamond (Resource): World Crisis Organisation" />
            </th>
            <td>
                <strong>Diamonds: Resources</strong>: Resources are things in the world that players interact with, e.g. Organisations, Locations, or Props. The map starts with the World Crisis Organisation as a resource in the centre.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <img src="https://static.goblinoid.co.uk/jeff-horton.uk/2e8f7af5-0500-4701-a11a-42a30c3cf615.png" alt="Triangle (Situation): Iraq War Protest" />
            </th>
            <td>
                <strong>Triangles: Situations</strong>: An event or status that effects the characters in some way. Occupations, hobbies, crises, etc.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

These will be connected to each other by lines, with a label explaining how the two are related.

Each stage also has a type that determines how you can modify the map during that stage:

<strong>Standard: </strong>Add a connection between an existing Character, Resource, or Situation and your player
character; or add a new GMC, Resource, or Situaltion and connect it to your player character. If you are linking to
another player character, discuss it with them first and agree on the relationship.

<strong>Major: </strong>Same as a standard stage, but connect to <em>two </em>existing or new elements. 

<strong>Meta: </strong>Choose one of the following three options:

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Connect: </strong>two non-player character elements
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Replace: </strong>Remove an existing connection to your player character, and replace it with another connection to an existing element, or create a new one.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Introduce: </strong>With another player's consent, create a new element and connect it with their player character. That player gets to define the nature of the new connection
    </li>
</ul>

Remember the Script Change tools. If a change is made to the map that you are unhappy with, or want to discuss, or if
new information makes you regret a previous choice, feel free to ask for a rewind or pause.

<h3>Step 1: Origin (Standard - One Addition)</h3>

Where did you come from, what were your formative experiences? We're your parents rich or poor, did thet have
connections that affected your life? Did you excel in a particular subject at school? Did you focus on a particular
career or lifestyle? Was there a major event that affected you and pushed you down a certain path?

Choose the die ratings for your Physical,Mental, and Social attributes, either assign a d10, a d8, and a d6, or assign a
d8 to all three.

<h3>Step 2: Life before (Major- Two Additions)</h3>

What were you before you became a Hammerhead Agent. Did you have a defining career, or membership of an organisation?
Were there ongoing events that impacted your life? Do you have a spouse or long-term partner?

Write down the statement that defines the 'Your Life Before' distinction. 

<h3>Step 3: Focus (Standard - One Addition)</h3>

What motivates you, or defines who you are the most. Is there a status or posession you are striving for? Is or was
there a situation, person, or organisation that inspired you? 

Fill out the die ratings for your training packages. You can assign a single d10, four d8s, four d6s, and the rest
default to d4s.

<h3>Step 4: Life-Changing Event (Meta - One Change)</h3>

What has been the most disruptive thing to happen to you? Did you have a major achievement, or suffer a great tragedy?
Did you witness somthing that changed your politics or beliefs? 

Write down the statements for your remaining two distinctions: 'Your approach or attitude', and 'Your Quirk or Quality'.

<h3>Step 5: Recruitment and Training (Major - Two Additions)</h3>

Was there a particular contact or experience that lead to your recruitment? Was there something that motivated you to
seek membership of the WCO? Was there something significant that happened whilst you were training? What defines your
relationship with your teammates?

You should try to ensure you have a connection to the World Crisis Organsiation and at least two player characters by
the end of this stage.

You should add your relationship to each of the player characters, assigning one a d10, one a d8, and the rest a d6. The
d10, and d8 should be for players you are connected to on the setting map. You may fill out the remaining relationship
slots with any GMCs you have a connection to, or leave them blank.

<h3>Everything else</h3>

The team building then proceeds as normal. Choose your Hammerhead model, and decide on your call signs. In Addition add
'Shared Background' to the a mission slot in the XP track. Once per mission, you can callback to any one of the elements
connected to your character as though it was a previous mission.
