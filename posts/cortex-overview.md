I have known about Cortex for about two years now. It took a while to properly grow on me, but has now supplanted D&D as
my sytem of choice. It has changed how I think about table-top roleplay, and I think it is making me a better player and
game moderator. I want to try and explain what it is, and share some of my thoughts on how it works, and what makes it
so good.

<h2>Origins</h2>

Cortex has been around for a while, underlying a bunch of IP tie-in RPGs. Recently Cortex Prime was kickstarted (by
Fandom?) and the core book was released late last year. Built out of mechanics distilled from these previous games and
collated into a modular toolkit. 

The legacy of previous games shines through. At the core there is a feedback loop between mechanics, story, and roleplay
that has obviously been polished and finessed through multiple iterations. Each module tweaks this in some often
saignificant way but still feels part of the cohesive whole.

<h2>How it works</h2>

Dice pools

<h3>Prime sets and distinctions</h3>

<h3>Narrative focus</h3>

Player-led

Episodes, scenes, beats

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Pro/con

Allows breaking the norms - splitting the party, jumping into action, de-emphases combat

Not always easy to moderate, lots to unlearn

<h2>Upcoming</h2>

On the horizon, there is an online toolset being developed by the same people who make D&D Beyond (but with the rights
to include digital access with physical book purchase.) 

<h3>Game pitches/games run</h3>
