The Dragon's Tooth, a mountainous promontory sticking out into the endless ocean. Home to the last few outposts of the
Guilds' hold over the lands. North of here civilisation loses its grip and gives way to the wilds of the north. Most
that come this way are travellers. Caravaneers, adventurers, and bounty hunters. It probably wouldn't even see those if
there were easier ways to trade with Moradin's Forge, the great but isolated Dwarven city deep in the Spire Mountains.
Those that do travel its heights usually stay at the Guardian's Rest Inn. A day from the Halfling town of Heartholme,
high in the mountains and the last stop before the treacherous pass to Bardryn's Crossing, where the caravans unload
into the dwarven barges.

It is here that our story is set. Attacks on trade caravan's by goblin marauders have increased over the spring. The
Caravaneer's Guild have offered a reward of one thousand gold pieces for any who would deal with the cause of these
attacks. Adventures have come from near and far, some for the Gold, some for the Glory, and other's have more personal
motives. You are one who has answered this call. Our story begins as the sun drops below the Spire Mountains and the
last of the night's travellers crosses the inn's threshold.

## The Adventure

This is a one-off Dungeons and Dragons® adventure for 4 to 6 players, designed to be an introduction to the game. You
will be playing a pre-generated character of level three, who will have a background giving them personal incentives to
be involved in the adventure. I aim for it to last roughly four hours, but precise length will be down to the choices
you and you characters make. 

There will probably be quite a bit of combat because that is what D&D® does best, but there will also be exploration and
intrigue, with plenty of opportunities to bring your character to life throughout. There is no need to know anything
about D&D or role-playing games beforehand, the adventure is designed with opportunities to teach the game as we play. 

Over the next few weeks I'll be releasing some setting information to whet your appetite, finishing with the cast of
characters. You will be able to pick who you want to play before the session. This will get you some secret background
information, and chance to personalise your character before we hit play.

## Out of Character Conduct

Role-playing games provide excellent opportunities for immersive escapism, exploring difficult or complex topics, and
portraying flawed characters. For this to be fun and rewarding for all, the out-of-character environment needs to be
inclusive and safe for everyone participating. You can help out with this, and I will present some tools and tips on the
night. If you treat everyone with respect and look out for the groups' enjoyment, you'll not go far wrong.

If you want to discuss this in more detail before the session, or there are themes that could make you uncomfortable
that I might not be aware of, please contact me in person or by email
