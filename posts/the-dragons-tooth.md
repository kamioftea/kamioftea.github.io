The main trade route is two days long, from Heartholme, the last market town in the Vale of Plenty. It climbs slowly for
a day roughly north east through the forests of the upper river Plenty. It picks its way through the rock crags of
Plenty's Edge, and a vast upland moor stretches out above. Ahead you will see the fortified walls of the Guardian's Rest
Inn. On the northern horizon the spine of the mountain ridge dominates, and the trail continues north to its lowest
pass. This is free from snow except in the darkest depths of winter. Form there it zig-zags down the much steeper North
Face dropping the small port town of Bardryn's Crossing. This is the East-most harbour for the Dwarven barges that sail
the Dragon's Maw Fjord to the docks of Moradin's Forge a day or two to the West.

The entrance to the Dragon's Tooth Ruby and Silver Mine overlooks the south side of the pass. About 5 miles south of the
Inn the Plenty flows through a deep gorge from where it flows from caves under the mountains. Clinging to the stone
walls and trees that grow there is an elven temple village, dedicated to Sehanine Moonbow, and home to the Well of
Mists. Further from the trail there are few signs of civilisation. Small Goblin, Human, and Elf tribes wander the
mountains, as well as the varied beasts and monsters that roam the wild places.

## Guardian's Rest Inn

This Inn is relatively new to the area, being founded a little under thirty years ago. When the city of Valeguard to the
North was lost to marauding orcs, the refugees began to settle the shores of the Dragon's Maw. The trade route through
the valley became vital to bring supplies from the Vale of Plenty to the less fertile northern shores. The Guardian's
Rest was built up from a crude shelter to the fortified inn of today by human refugees Arveene and Darvin Tallstag.

The inn has beds and stables for about three trade caravans and a handful of other travellers. It has a forge, a
brewery, a shrine to the five pantheons, and space for a handful of market stalls. It employs a small staff of permanent
guards, supplemented by caravan guards as required. The more civilised local tribes will visit to trade with the
caravans, as will the Dwarves of the mine and the Elves of the temple. Darvin and Skamos, the Tallstags' Tiefling child
are both involved in maintaining the Guild of the Arcane's network of teleportation circles, including one inside the
Inn's walled compound.

## The Dragon's Tooth Ruby and Silver Mine

This mine is much older than the Inn. Shortly after the Three Cities signed the Charter of Alliance and the Guilds
started to cast their gaze out into the world. Prospectors, lead by divine guidance from Baern discovered rich veins of
iron, silver, and gems. They founded a mine, and the first shaft was dug a little over five hundred years ago.

Abodes and facilities are built into the long exhausted upper levels of the mine are home to about fifty dwarves;
miners, craftsdwarves, traders, and priests. There are also some Gnomish tinkerers and a family of Halfling chefs and
brewers.

Under the mine is a warren of old and new mine shafts, and there still seems to be plenty of rich deposits left to
exploit. Many of the deeper shafts have broken into the caverns that lie under the mountains, and abandoned shafts are
sealed with heavy iron doors and bulkheads. The Dwarves must keep constant vigil against the terrors of the deep.

## The Temple of Sehanine Moonbow

It is said that one of Sehanine Moonbow's arrows fell to earth gouging the huge rift out of which the river Plenty
flows. There is certainly something otherworldly about the forests in and around the rift. Here dotted amongst the trees
rise slender elven towers, and elegant halls hang in the canopy. This is one of the largest temples to Sehanine Moonbow
in the lands of the Guilds. Priests and scholars come here to learn and continue the great sagas that form the oral
history of the Elves.

The cliffs of Plenty's Edge rise above even the temple's tower. At the highest point there is a mystical spring
surrounded by five standing stones. The mossy clearing is always enshrouded in faintly glowing mists, but the Moon's
reflection in the pool is never obscured. Is is said that those devoted to the Elven deities are sometimes blessed with
visions if they stare long enough into the pool.

## Bardryn's Crossing

Before the fall of Valeguard, this was a small fishing village with an Inn for those few traveller's who had need to
travel the Dragon's Tooth. The now ruined Bardryn's Landing on the North shore saw the traffic from Valeguard head West
to Moradin's Forge, or by sea to the capitol of Randall's Watch. Now Valeguard is no more, the trading families have
moved South across the Fjord, and it's port is vital for bringing food from the Vale of Plenty to the refugee
settlements that dot the shores of the Dragon's Maw.

It is everything you'd expect from a port town on the edge of the civilised world. The Mayor and the city watch are in
the pockets of the Merchant families and smuggling gangs. There is a walled enclave where the Mayor and richer families
live. The Mage's and Caravaneer's Guilds have outposts here. Staying at the Soaring Dragon Inn here is expensive, but
relatively safe. The fortified port office of the Ruby and Silver Mine offers a secure place for those friendly with the
Dwarves. Everyone else takes their chances in the various dockside inn's, which are 'safe' if you're in the good books
of which ever merchant house or gang operates out of there.

## The Wider World

The Dragon's Tooth is on the northern edge of the Lands of the Guilds. An alliance of three cities formed nearly five
hundred years ago by the Charter of Alliance. This ushered in an age of stability, exploration, and innovation. The
Plenty flows south, eventually joining the Greenwater and flowing out east into the Endless Ocean through the habour
city of Randall's Watch. Most of the Guilds have their headquarters here, and it is the closest to a capital that the
Alliance have. To the west in the Spire Mountains is the dwarven city of Moradin's Forge, and the Market City of
Glitterglade sits on the shore of an immense lake deep in the forests to the south.

Further north is the fallen city of Valeguard, testament that civilisation cannot always keep the wilds at bay. Little
is known beyond that, warring bands of orcs and worse making short work of those who have ventured out. The Endless
Ocean spreads out to the east, home to merfolk and monsters. There are some inhabited islands that trade with the
guilds. To the south the land becomes a vast desert, nomadic tribes of Dragonborn live there and occasionally bring
exotic goods and tales to the towns on the southern border. To the west rise the Spire Mountains, these inhospitable
peaks are claimed by clans of giants and the Guilds keep a healthy distance.
