Things had been going well for the Halpi 23rd. They'd marched north through the mountains with little resistance.
Herneas's scouts had started using their overnight camps as a base of operations, and the extra intelligence had been
useful.

It was about a week into their march north, they were preparing to break camp when an Elven mage appeared in Morrolan's
command tent, with orders for Herneas.

"You are requested to support our forces in the Twilight Glades, we are being overrun by abyssal fiends, your rangers
would be a great asset."

After a brief discussion, it was decided that both Herneas and Morrolan would brought through the elven ways to defend
the Glades. The journey was nightmarish, and his troops were definitely shaken when they appeared. Morrolan had little
time to rally his forces as they were beset by abyssal horrors almost as soon as they appeared.

*The horde of Lower Abyssals is broken, but the rest of the Abyss is bearing down*

Morrolan took on the giant Archfiend, he manage to put up a good fight, but one of it's burning claws caught his helmet,
and Morrolan blacked out.

He came too in a makeshift camp. The scattered Dwarves had managed to escape and start to reform, treat their wounded
and build some rudimentary defenses. The Abyssals had been left to take the portals as the Halpi 23rd was decisively
routed.

*The battle ends. Herneas looks on, unable as the Bulwalkers are surrounded, but not destroyed. The abyssals hold two
portals, and contest the only one that the Dwarves could hold.*

After a few days of recovery the Herneas's Rangers and Morrolan's Halpi 23rd were battle ready once more. Ranger's
scouts were reporting that they had somehow been followed by the goblin king they had defeated in the mountains. The
goblin rabble were now marching towards one of the portal nexuses, so Morrolan and Herneas moved their forces to
intercept.

*Battle is joined, except for the cowardly flea bag riders.*

The fight against the trolls was bloody, but eventually the brutes were no match for the Dwarves skill and tenacity. The
dogs seemed to have worried the wolf riders, they hesitated and that was enough for Morrolan and one unit of iron clad
to break that flank one unit at a time.

This freed the Bulwarker core of the 23rd to turn to deal with the giant and the king. Eventually all the goblins were
dead or scattered. The rabble of archers were still dealing out death and held one of the portals. The remaining Dwarves
hunkered down to weather the storm. They were too few to advance and break the goblins, but their armour could withstand
the arrows until the goblins' quivers were empty.

As the sun set the two forces retreated from the field, leaving many dead behind on both sides. The Halpi 23rd were
almost spent. They were sent back through the waves to recuperate on home ground.

*The much deminished forces on both sides fight to a stalemate.*
