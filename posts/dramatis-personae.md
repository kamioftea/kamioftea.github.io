The heroes that have answered the call of the Caravaneer's guild are many and diverse. The characters below are designed
to be a rough outline for you to shape as you please. They are written with neutral gender and without physical
descriptions so that you can have them present with whichever identities you prefer. Once the group has decided on their
characters I will send you some more details about the character you choose. You are welcome to alter any part of their
background or personality, but please discuss it with me so that I can keep the rest of the world up to date.

## Bardryn Fireforge, Devoted Dwarven Forgemaster
A cleric devoted to Baern, dwarven deity of the forge. Bardryn came from humble beginnings to make a name for
themselves, at least locally. They are a skilled smith and stalwart protector of the few outposts of civilisation that
stand on the Dragon's Tooth.

## Caelynn Evenwood, Estranged Noble Half-elf Warlock
A highborn merchant who had a life of luxury laid out at their feet from birth. Inadvisable dabbling with infernal
powers has led to Caelynn cutting ties with their family and hiding behind multiple masks and identities to maintain
their connections. They now seek redemption by performing great deeds, and also a bit of treasure to keep up their
lifestyle won't go amiss. 

## Grim Tallstag, Solitary Human Ranger
One of the children of the landlords of the Guardian's Rest Inn. Grim knows nor wants any other home than the wild
mountains they grew up in. An adept, solitary hunter who knows Dragon's Tooth well, and will shoot anything that
threatens it.

## Korinn Yarjerit, Mercenary Dragonborn Bodyguard
Korinn has spent most of their lives on the high seas of the Endless Ocean as a marine. An altercation with the new
captain left them with a sore head and a bad reputation. Korinn is up to guard anyone with a bit of coin, and their last
employer left them in the Inn looking for the next job. 

## Myev, Wandering Half-orc War Skald
A refugee of the fall of Valeguard, and raised amongst the veterans of the city, it was a tough life of cold winds and
distrustful stares. Now the threat of the north has dissipated, they wander the roads of the Guilds. Myev plays in the
inns and taverns for coin, and earns a bit on the side as a Waywatcher, an undercover informant for the Caravaneers'
Guild.

## Myznar, Angry Goblin Freedom Fighter
A hot-headed leader of a group of rebel goblins that have set themselves against the local shamen. Ever since they were
trapped in a cave with a wild bear, they have been able to call on spirits to enter bestial rages. They solve problems
directly, usually with their axe. They've approached the Inn hearing that allies to their cause may be gathering.

## Rowan Ilphelkiir, Half-elf Green Knight
Rowan was kidnapped by a coven of hags at an early age. They were rescued by a paladin of Rillifane Rallathil, and feel
they have a debt to repay. They have come to the Dragon's Tooth on a pilgrimage to test their devotion to their new oath
as a paladin. Rowan was ambushed and robbed by goblins near the Inn, they are now determined to make the goblins see the
error of their ways.

## Sariel Galakiir, Mystical Elven Druid
Having lost their mother to the perils of adventuring at an early age, Sariel has become convinced they have inherited
her destiny. Growing up in the mystical glades of the local elven temple, the Fey and the divine have always been part
of their life. Gifted with a vision of the Goblin threat, they feel drawn to the Inn.

## Sindri Nackle, Prophetic Gnome Urchin
A gnome orphaned in the depths of Moradin's Forge, Sindri has taught themselves magic from a stolen spellbook. Their
studies have given them and understanding of the threads of fate, and allowed them to earn a few coins. Approaching the
Inn on their way to the divination pool at the temple Sindri saw that their fates were in some way entwined with the
place. 

## Skamos Tallstag, Gifted Tiefling Sorceror
Skamos is the tiefling child of the owners of the tavern, born shortly after the founding of the Inn in mysterious
circumstances. They have always had innate magics, and were sent away to the Mage's Guild to learn to control this. They
are studying to work for the Guild maintaining the teleportation network, and have noticed something suspicious.

## Stixil, Sneaky Goblin Scout
Having run away at an early age and fallen in with a fence who operates in Bardryn's Crossing, Stixil is very sneaky,
and highly independent. They have quick fingers and reflexes, and are as home in the wilds as they are in town. When
their wits fail, they can be deadly with their shortswords, especially if they catch their victim by surprise. They have
recently fallen in with Myznar's rebel goblins.

## Trym Tealeaf, Disciplined Halfling Monk
Trym retreated to the Monastery of Elemental Harmony when about a quarter of their village were killed by starving
wolves, and the plague they brought with them. They are calm and disciplined, and have mastered traditional halfling
weapons to the point they are just an extension of their own body and mind. They come to the inn seeking a gem stolen
from their monastery by goblins a week ago.
