So it had all come to this. A much reduced Halpi 23rd was due to be deployed to the front line at the Edge of the Abyss.
What forces Morrolan had left he formed into a single block to anchor the right flank he was assigned to. Supporting
them were Herneas's Rangers, along with Bannick Kholearm and Craggoth.

The noxious fumes clung to the ground, breathing was difficult. This would be a hard fight. Holding the center was a
force of salamanders. Beyond them a detachment of humans, here to seek revenge for their homeland. Against Morrolan were
more of the fiends from the Abyss, and there were also some of the Dwarves hated kin, and an army built from the bones
of those who had already fallen.

*The reduced Halpi 23rd form up in the frontline against the Abyss.*

Morrolan cautiously advanced to hold a bottleneck between some form of Abyssal shrine that blocked the right flank, and
the Salamanders holding a hill on Morrolan's left. The rangers were laying down good covering fire, and one of the
smaller abyssal units was routed from that alone.

The abyssal mages were returning fire with fire and lightning from the volcanic clouds that shrouded the field in near
darkness. One of the winged champions of the Abyss was sent to dispatch the rangers, but they held firm and cut it down.

*Artakl is caught, as the Dwarves lay down a hail of fire.*

Meanwhile in the Dwarves' centre, an assassin sent by the Salamanders was caught by the Abyssals and cut down. Craggoth
charged in, smashing the fiends with his huge rocky fists, and Bannick was not far behind, his huge mining drill
throwing chunks of the Abyssals flying.

They took down one unit easily and Craggoth easily took the counter charge from the Abyssal reserves, their blades
barely chipping his colossal form. Morrolan held his forces, anchoring the Dwarven line and guarding Craggoth from being
surrounded.

*Bannick and Craggoth charge in side by side, as the Halpi 23rd guard their flank.*

The Rangers recovered from the assault by the winged champion and resumed covering fire on the flank. The Efreet was
eventually forced to ground, and they were freed to support the centre.

Craggoth and Bannick continued to cut a blood swathe through the Abyssal ranks, and the Halpi 23rd eventually got stuck
in to grinding down the abyssal horde. Unfortunately not before that horde had piled into the Salamanders main force,
and breaking them.

This was a minor set back in a battle that was decisively in the favour of the Green Lady's forces. Their center had
crumbled, but both flanks were dominated by good with minimal losses. There were a few Abyssal Dwarves and fiends still
left in the centre, but they were quickly surrounded from the flanks, and could do nothing but flee back to the rift
that has spawned them.

*The Dwarves mass against the remaining abyssal forces.*
