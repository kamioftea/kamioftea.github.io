A solution for [Advent of Code 2017 - Day 23](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/23)

## Part 1

The first part of today's task is a reworking of [day 18 part 1](/aoc-2017-day-18-duet). As I mentioned in my write up
of that, there were some lessons I learnt from solving part 2 that I wanted to work back into my parser. 

Firstly there was a bug where by I had been treating the first column of values as always being references, and this
didn't hold. Splitting out the value type in the regex as before was very hard to read, so I factored that out into a
function that was called for each match that could be either type. Secondly passing in the current registers when trying
to extract a value from an instruction caused a lot of noise and it was hard to read, so I used implicits to hide the
boiler-plate.

{% raw %}
```scala
sealed trait Value {
  def read(implicit registers: Map[Char, Long]): Long
}
// defined trait Value

case class Ref(register: Char) extends Value {
  override def read(implicit registers: Map[Char, Long]): Long =
    registers.getOrElse(register, 0)
}
// defined class Ref

case class Literal(value: Long) extends Value {
  override def read(implicit registers: Map[Char, Long]): Long = value
}
// defined class Literal

case class Instruction(command: String, value1: Value, value2: Value)
// defined class Instruction

implicit def valueFromString(str: String): Value = (
  if (str.matches("[a-z]")) Ref(str.charAt(0))
  else Literal(str.toLong)
)
// warning: there was one feature warning; for details, enable `:setting -feature' or `:replay -feature'
// valueFromString: (str: String)Value

val LineMatcher = "(set|sub|mul|jnz) ([a-z]|-?\\d+) ([a-z]|-?\\d+)".r
// LineMatcher: scala.util.matching.Regex = (set|sub|mul|jnz) ([a-z]|-?\d+) ([a-z]|-?\d+)

def instFromLine(line: String): Instruction = line match {
  case LineMatcher(c, v1, v2) => Instruction(c, v1, v2)
}
// instFromLine: (line: String)Instruction

def countMults(program: Vector[Instruction], regs: Map[Char, Long] = Map.empty): Int = {
  def iter(registers: Map[Char, Long], position: Int, mulCount: Int): Int = {
    if (!program.isDefinedAt(position)) mulCount
    else {
      implicit val _ = registers
      program(position) match {
        case Instruction("set", Ref(r), v2) =>
          iter(registers.updated(r, v2.read), position + 1, mulCount)
        case Instruction("sub", Ref(r), v2) =>
          iter(registers.updated(r, registers(r) - v2.read), position + 1, mulCount)
        case Instruction("mul", Ref(r), v2) =>
          iter(registers.updated(r, registers(r) * v2.read), position + 1, mulCount + 1)
        case Instruction("jnz", v1, v2) =>
          iter(registers, if (v1.read != 0) position + v2.read.toInt else position + 1, mulCount)
      }
    }
  }

  iter(regs.withDefaultValue(0), 0, 0)
}
// <console>:22: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
// It would fail on the following inputs: Instruction("mul", Literal(_), _), Instruction("set", Literal(_), _), Instruction("sub", Literal(_), _), Instruction((x: String forSome x not in ("jnz", "mul", "set", "sub")), Literal(_), _), Instruction((x: String forSome x not in ("jnz", "mul", "set", "sub")), Ref(_), _), Instruction(String(), Literal(_), _)
//              program(position) match {
//                     ^
// countMults: (program: Vector[Instruction], regs: Map[Char,Long])Int
```
{% endraw %}

I created an example instruction for each of the possible instruction types and made sure to include the static jnz test
that was missing last time and caught me out. I also built a small test program to check that the interpreter was
correct.

{% raw %}
```scala
import org.scalatest.{FunSuite, Matchers}
// import org.scalatest.{FunSuite, Matchers}

class Day23Part1Test extends FunSuite with Matchers {

  test("testInstFromLine") {
    instFromLine("sub a 23") shouldBe Instruction("sub", Ref('a'), Literal(23))
    instFromLine("mul b -2") shouldBe Instruction("mul", Ref('b'), Literal(-2))
    instFromLine("set b 4") shouldBe Instruction("set", Ref('b'), Literal(4))
    instFromLine("jnz c d") shouldBe Instruction("jnz", Ref('c'), Ref('d'))
    instFromLine("jnz 1 2") shouldBe Instruction("jnz", Literal(1), Literal(2))
  }

  test("testCountMults") {
    countMults(
      """set a 4
        |set b 1
        |mul b a
        |jnz a 2
        |jnz 1 3
        |sub a 1
        |jnz 1 -4""".stripMargin.lines.map(instFromLine).toVector
    ) shouldBe 5

    countMults(
      """set a 8
        |set b 1
        |mul b a
        |jnz a 2
        |jnz 1 3
        |sub a 1
        |jnz 1 -4""".stripMargin.lines.map(instFromLine).toVector
    ) shouldBe 9
  }

}
// defined class Day23Part1Test

(new Day23Part1Test).execute()
// Day23Part1Test:
// - testInstFromLine
// - testCountMults
``` 
{% endraw %}

With this in place I can get the `mul` instruction count when running the code.

{% raw %}
```scala
import scala.io.Source
// import scala.io.Source

val program = (
  Source.fromResource("day23input.txt")
    .getLines()
    .map(instFromLine)
    .toVector
)
// program: Vector[Instruction] = Vector(Instruction(set,Ref(b),Literal(79)), Instruction(set,Ref(c),Ref(b)), Instruction(jnz,Ref(a),Literal(2)), Instruction(jnz,Literal(1),Literal(5)), Instruction(mul,Ref(b),Literal(100)), Instruction(sub,Ref(b),Literal(-100000)), Instruction(set,Ref(c),Ref(b)), Instruction(sub,Ref(c),Literal(-17000)), Instruction(set,Ref(f),Literal(1)), Instruction(set,Ref(d),Literal(2)), Instruction(set,Ref(e),Literal(2)), Instruction(set,Ref(g),Ref(d)), Instruction(mul,Ref(g),Ref(e)), Instruction(sub,Ref(g),Ref(b)), Instruction(jnz,Ref(g),Literal(2)), Instruction(set,Ref(f),Literal(0)), Instruction(sub,Ref(e),Literal(-1)), Instruction(set,Ref(g),Ref(e)), Instruction(sub,Ref(g),Ref(b)), Instruction(jnz,Ref(g),Literal(-8)), Instruction(sub,Ref(d),Literal(-1)), Instructio...

countMults(program)
// res1: Int = 5929
```
{% endraw %}

## Part 2

For part two I initially tried running the code with the debug flag `a` set: `countMults(program, Map('a' -> 1))`, but
this was obviously not going to complete anytime soon. I put in a few debug `println`s to try and get a handle on what
was going on and ended up annotating and optimising the program in place.

The first section is just initialisation, and is how the value of `a` actually influences the execution. 
{% raw %}
```
  set b 79       | Intiialise b and c, this is where diferent  
  set c b        | coders' inputs were differentiated. In my 
  jnz a 2        | case, 79.
  jnz 1 5        | Then if a != 0 multiply by 100, add 100,000,
  mul b 100      | and add 17000 to c. Which is how the scale
  sub b -100000  | problems I encountered were introduced:
  set c b        | - a=0: Two nested loops go from 2 to 79
  sub c -17000   | - a=1: 1,000 x above, loops are 2 to 107,900+ 
```
{% endraw %}

From there there are a number of loops. I've labeled the jnz targets below on the left. Then it is noticeable that g is
often used in a pattern:

* Set g = var1
* Subtract var2 from g
* If g != 0 skip the next line or restart the current loop

Which is equivalent to if(var1 == var2) set a thing or break out of the current loop. I've broken the program down to
the loop structure, and factored out the lines using g into the equivalent if statements. 
{% raw %}
```
G: set f 1       | :outer loop {
   set d 2       |   set f = 1, d = 2
C: set e 2       |   :middle loop {
                 |      set e = 2
B: set g d       |      :inner loop {
   mul g e       |        
   sub g b       |        
>A jnz g 2       |        if (d * e == b) set f = 0
   set f 0       |        
A: sub e -1      |        
   set g e       |        
   sub g b       |        if(e++ == b) break
>B jnz g -8      |      }
   sub d -1      |      
   set g d       |      
   sub g b       |      if(d++ == b) break
>C jnz g -13     |   } 
>D jnz f 2       |   
   sub h -1      |   if (f == 0) h++
D: set g b       |   
   sub g c       |   
>E jnz g 2       |   if(b == c) exit  
>? jnz 1 3       |   
E: sub b -17     |   b += 17
>G jnz 1 -23     | }
```
{% endraw %}

The inner loop and middle loops are essentially looping `d` and `e` through all the integers between 2 and the current
`b` setting a flag if `d * e == b`, but still completing both loops. The inner loop can be refactored into `if (b % d ==
0) f = true`. If this is ever true it is more optimal to break out of both loops immediately. It can also be optimised
break out of the middle loop once the counter exceeds âˆš`b`. This means I can write the middle loop in Scala as:

{% raw %}
```scala
def hasFactor(b: Int): Boolean = {
  val rootB = Math.sqrt(b).toInt

  def iter(d: Int): Boolean = {
    if(d > rootB) return false
    if(b % d == 0) return true
    iter(d + 1)
  }

  iter(2)
}
// hasFactor: (b: Int)Boolean
```
{% endraw %}

The outer loop is then incrementing b by 17 each time and incrementing a counter if b has a factor. Incorporating the
initialisation from the initial value of `b` which then makes this a general implementation for any of the individual
puzzle inputs as far as I can tell:

{% raw %}
```scala
def decomposed(seed: Int): Int =
{
  val start = seed * 100 + 100000
  val end = start + 17000

  def iter(b: Int, h: Int = 0): Int = {
    if(b > end) return h
    iter(b + 17, if(hasFactor(b)) h + 1 else h)
  }

  iter(start)
}
// decomposed: (seed: Int)Int

decomposed(79)
// res2: Int = 907
```
{% endraw %}

It is worth noting that whilst there is nothing obvious to be done about the inefficient modulus with the instruction
set available, the early break can be implemented. Given that 907 of the 1000 outer loops would then break after less
than âˆš124,900 iterations of the middle loop. This probably isn't enough to make it viable, but still a major
improvement. The change would be fairly simple: add `jnz 1 9` after `set f = 0`, and increment the `jnz` instructions
for the loops outside that by 1 to account for the extra instruction.
