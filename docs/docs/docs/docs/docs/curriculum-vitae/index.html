<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I’m a full-stack web developer with a decade of professional experience. I have worked with
	multiple languages and frameworks, including Javascript with React, PHP with Laminas, Java with
	Spring Boot. I have been involved in the full software delivery lifecycle: Researching
	requirements and producing prototypes for user feedback, developing and testing applications;
	then deploying, monitoring, and supporting them in production.
</p>
<p>
	Outside of work I play a lot of tabletop games, and take part in Live Action Roleplay. As part
	of these have written a number of small personal projects including character management
	systems, and mock futuristic computer interfaces for Sci-Fi games. I use these to experiment
	with other technologies that I can then introduce to my professional work where appropriate.
	Recently these have included Rust,, Scala with Play Framework, MongoDB, and containerisation
	with Docker.
</p>
